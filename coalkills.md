# Coal Kills. America Should Go Fission.

## Background 
Use of coal for generation of power has drawbacks. Mining damages our environment. Transportation of coal to power plants is expensive. Ash byproduct must be stored.

Critically, emissions into our atmosphere contain materials that cause health problems, which have been quantified.

## Question
**Student research question is 
concise, 
direct, and 
practical.**

How many lives lost due to pollution can be saved by replacing coal power generation in the United States with nuclear power generation?

## Data Sources

Data files from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

## Methods

From source data, location, coal consumption, and power output were gathered.

Reshaped data were used to visualize the location and intensity of use of coal for power generation.

## Findings
**Student can communicate their main findings in 1-2 sentences.**

Replacing existing coal-based power generation in the United States will save 3000 lives per year, once replacement is complete. 

Lives are being lost while this coal generation is still in operation, and faster replacement will save more lives.

## Comment
Demand for electrical power will not decline. Addtional power generation plant will be built. Similar plant can be used to replace existing coal plant and eliminate harmful pollution.

## Learnings
**Student potentially had to alter their course on the projects based on the problem and the data. these learnings are documented and articulated by the project.**

I could not find 'prime-mover' level, or plant-level data on pollution. Finding or gathering this data could help decide an order for replacement of prime-movers or plants.






But the waste products produced by burning coal are a far larger concern.

Each megawatt-hour of power generated leads to air pollution and emission of carbon dioxide. Per megawatt-hour:
carbon dioxide
sulphur dioxide
nitrogen oxides
mercury
other articulate 


Annual coal report

637,217 thousand short tons 2018 for electrical generation






one ton of coal -> 2e7 BTU
power plant efficiency -> 0.37
one ton of coal (2e7 * 0.37) = 7.4e6 electric
1 BTU = 293 kwh

ton of coal * (BTUthermal / ton) * efficiency * (kwh/BTU) * (Mwh/Kwh) = MWh per ton

MWH / (mwh / ton) = tons



3 pounds 


2,168 kWh of electricity.
