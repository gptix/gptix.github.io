# Coal Kills. America Should Go Fission.

## Drawbacks of Coal

Use of coal for generation of power has drawbacks. Mining damages our environment. Transportation of coal to power plants is expensive. Ash byproduct must be stored.

### Humanity will need (and will get) much more electrial power.

Humanity continues to grow in population, and wants to eliminate poverty. Much more electrical power must be generated. Despite coal's drawbacks, huge amounts of coal power plant are being built. 

Environmental and health costs of coal are ingored paritally or completely, so coal is viewed as the least expensive alternative for
new power plant.

### How Much Better Can We Make It?

I would like to know how much human cost can be avoided by replacing coal with another source of power. 

Given time constraints, I have limited investigation:
- I use only data about the United States.
- I use only calculations about airborne pollution.
- I assume coal generation will be replaced with nuclear power.

Conclusions based on information on the United States can probably be generalized to the entire earth in a strightforward manner.

Health costs from waterborne pollution, and environmental costs, can be modeled using data sets outside my investigation.

Other replacements for coal (e.g, natural gas) have different costs, benefits, and drawbacks. Modeling these is more complicated.

My question focuses to:

### How many lives can be saved by replacing coal generation for the United States with nuclear power?

I used information available from the U.S. government. I used data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and from the U.S. Environmental Projection Agency. I also used information from the book __Thorium: energy cheaper than coal__ by Robert Hargraves. Links are below.

I analyzed data using data science tools and techniques, detailed below.
 
* Discussion of findings

### Burning Coal Releases Harmful Pollution.
Coal-based generation of power has been a great benefit to mankind. But, burning coal has inevitable, baneful, effects on the environment and humans. 

These include damage to ecosystems, heat and material pollution into waters, and emission of harmful gases and material into the atmosphere.

### Air Pollution from Coal is Well Studied.
I examined only the emissions into the atmosphere, and modeled existing damages, which will be eliminated when coal-based generation is replaced. I model replacment using nuclear power, which completely eliminates release of pollutants.

### Coal Power Plants Span the United States.

Coal plants vary in the mount of coal they burn. They are clustered near rivers and the ocean.

### Airborne Pollution form Coal Kills Thousands of Americans Each Year.

Coal also damages our ecology and pollutes land and water. But, focusing on related air pollution, coal kills thousands in the United States every year.

### Nuclear Power Plants Emit Zero Pollutants.

In fact, coal plants emit, as part of hteir airborne pollution, hugely more radiation than nuclear power plants.

### Faster is Much Better.

The sooner we move from coal as a power source, the sooner we will save thousands of lives. Every year we have not stopped using coal power, humans are killed by coal air pollution.

### Related Follow-on Questions

**What differences between power plants exist?**

I will search for more granular data about emissions of individual plants and prime movers, if available. This could help prioritize removal of coal generators.

**What other damages does coal inflict?**

I have not investigated health costs of mining and transporting coal, nor health costs related to coal ash and material released into waters. I suspect these costs are subsstantial, and strengthen argument for removing coal power plant.

**How do other replacments measure up?**

Natural gas plants are a common replacement for coal plants. Natual gas plants produce very little carbon dioxide or pollutants. However, substantial methane is released during production and transport. Methane is a greenhouse gas, so use of natural gas to generate electrical power involves release of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

### Exciting Companies and Organizations
I think the companies most likely to succeed soon in commercializing molten salt reactors are
- **Terrestrial Energy** - https://www.terrestrialenergy.com/
- **ThorCon** - http://thorconpower.com/

I think these are most likely to get there first because they have chosen to pursue molten salt without concentrating on use of thorium as fuel (I know, fertile not fissile).

**Flibe Energy**, led by Kirk Sorensen, is concentrating on designing and building a Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR). Use of thorium, rather than uranium, as fuel allow for a further reduction in waste, and higher production of very valuable medical (nad other-purposed) isotopes.
