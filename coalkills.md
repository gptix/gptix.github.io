Student research question is 
concise, 
direct, and 
practical. 

How many lives can be saved by replacing coal power generation in the United States with nuclear power generation?




Student can communicate their main findings in 1-2 sentences. ls


Replacing existing coal-based power generation in the United States will save 3000 lives per year, once replacement is complete. Lives are being lost while this coal generation is still in operation.




Student potentially had to alter their course on the projects based on the problem and the data, 

I could not find 'prime-mover' level, or plant-level data on pollution. Finding or gathering this data could help decide an order for replacement of prime-movers or plants.




these learnings are documented and articulated by the project.






Using coal to generate power comes at great environmental cost. Mining coal destroys or disturbs land ecosystems. Carrying enourmous amounts of coal to power plants for burning is an impressive cost itself.

But the waste products produced by burning coal are a far larger concern.

Each megawatt-hour of power generated leads to air pollution and emission of carbon dioxide. Per megawatt-hour:
carbon dioxide
sulphur dioxide
nitrogen oxides
mercury
other articulate 


Annual coal report

637,217 thousand short tons 2018 for electrical generation






one ton of coal -> 2e7 BTU
power plant efficiency -> 0.37
one ton of coal (2e7 * 0.37) = 7.4e6 electric
1 BTU = 293 kwh

ton of coal * (BTUthermal / ton) * efficiency * (kwh/BTU) * (Mwh/Kwh) = MWh per ton

MWH / (mwh / ton) = tons



3 pounds 


2,168 kWh of electricity.
