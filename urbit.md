Everyone knows I like programming a lot.

Urbit seems incredible. The vocabulary will be new to you, unless you already know

Urbit has the Hooniverse. This has Galaxies, Stars, Planets, Moons, Comets, Ships, and more.

Ships in the Hooniverse can communicate via a network. for this, each needs an ID.

To use Urbit:
Install a Linux operating system.
Get a copy of the urbit install file.
Run the installer.
Run ./urbit

Follow the instructions.
