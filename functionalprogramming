title: Functional Programming
subtitle: Why not program right?
---

Everyone knows I like programming.

And, if one is to program, why not do it properly?

Of course, **Lisps** are the best, having the indomitable **defmacro**.

But **Haskell** is great, too. I like monads, and algebraic datatypes in general.

But those who use less functional languages can take heart, as many languages increasingly add functions as first-class objects, anonymous functions, higher-order functions, and so on.

I'm using **Python** right now, and it does have lambdas.  But what will be really neat is progress on **Hy**, a Lisp that boils down to the Python AST.
